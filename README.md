## What Does This Project Do?

This is a **full-stack web application** — it has two parts:

- **Frontend** (what users see): HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pages that run in the browser.
- **Backend** (the engine): A Node.js server that handles logins, stores data, and responds to requests from the frontend.

Think of it like a restaurant: the frontend is the dining room customers see, the backend is the kitchen, and the database is the pantry.

### How it works

When a user fills in the sign-up form, the browser sends the data to the Node.js server. The server hashes the password (turns it into a scrambled string so it can never be read), saves the user to MongoDB, and replies with a **JWT token** — a small encrypted ticket that proves the user is logged in. Every future request from the browser includes that ticket.

## Technologies Used

Here is every tool this project uses, and a plain-English explanation of what each one does.

| Technology | What it does |
|------------|-------------|
| **HTML5** | The skeleton of the page — defines headings, buttons, images, sections, etc. |
| **CSS3** | Controls everything visual: colours, fonts, layout, spacing, hover effects, and animations. |
| **JavaScript** | Adds interactivity — scroll effects, mobile menu toggle, form validation, animations. |

## Running This Project on Your Computer

This is a **static website** — no installation, no server, and no terminal commands required.
Just open the files and you're done.

---

### Option A — Open directly in your browser (simplest)

1. Find the downloaded project folder on your computer.
2. Double-click `index.html`.
3. It opens in your default browser instantly.

> **Note:** Some browsers restrict certain features (like web fonts or API calls) when opening
> a file directly from your hard drive. If something looks broken, use Option B instead.

---

### Option B — VS Code Live Server (recommended)

This gives you a proper local web server that auto-refreshes the page every time you save a file.

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) — it's free.
2. Open VS Code, then open the project folder: **File → Open Folder**.
3. Click the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar (looks like four squares).
4. Search for **Live Server** and install it (published by Ritwick Dey).
5. Right-click `index.html` in the file explorer on the left → **Open with Live Server**.
6. Your browser opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5500` and auto-refreshes on every save.

---

### Option C — Python's built-in server (if you have Python installed)

```bash
# In your terminal, navigate into the project folder, then run:
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open your browser and go to **http://localhost:8000**

---

## Putting Your Site Online (Deployment)

Once you are happy with the site locally, you can publish it to the internet for free.

### Option 1 — GitHub Pages (free, instant, no setup required)

Your code is already on GitHub ✓ — publishing is just a few clicks.

1. Go to your repository page on GitHub.
2. Click the **Settings** tab near the top of the page.
3. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **Pages**.
4. Under **Branch**, select `main` from the dropdown.
5. Leave the folder set to `/ (root)` and click **Save**.
6. Wait about 30 seconds, then refresh the Settings → Pages page.
7. A green box will appear with your live URL:
   ```
   https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
   ```
8. Share that link — your site is now live and accessible to anyone.

> Every time you push changes to the `main` branch, GitHub Pages automatically updates the live site.

---

### Option 2 — Netlify (drag & drop — even easier)

1. Go to [https://netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and create a free account.
2. On your Netlify dashboard, click **Add new site** → **Deploy manually**.
3. Open your project folder on your computer.
4. Drag the entire folder onto the Netlify upload area.
5. Netlify uploads and deploys it instantly — you get a live public URL in seconds.

> You can also connect Netlify to your GitHub repository so it automatically re-deploys every time you push new code.

## Customising the Look & Feel

You don't need to understand all the code to make this site your own.
Here are the most common things people change, and exactly where to find them.

> 💡 **Fastest way to rename the brand:**
> In VS Code, press **Ctrl + Shift + H** (Windows) or **Cmd + Shift + H** (Mac)
> to open Find & Replace across all files. Search for `Portfolio` and replace it with your brand name everywhere at once.

### Colours

Open `css/projects.css` and look for the `:root` block near the top of the file:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #ffffff;   /* Main brand colour — buttons, links, highlights */
  --secondary-color: #a0a0a0;  /* Accent colour — hover states, borders */
}
```
Change the hex values to any colour you want. Pick colours at [coolors.co](https://coolors.co).

### Text content

| What to change | File to open | What to look for in that file |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Company name (`Portfolio`) | All `.html` files | Use Find & Replace to update it everywhere |
| Hero headline | `about.html` | The `<h1>` tag inside the section with class `.hero` |
| Hero subheading / description | `about.html` | The `<p>` tag directly beneath the `<h1>` |
| Navigation menu links | All `.html` files | The `<nav>` tag → the `<ul>` list items inside it |
| Footer text and links | All `.html` files | The `<footer>` tag at the bottom of each page |
| Browser tab title | All `.html` files | The `<title>` tag inside `<head>` at the top |

### Fonts

Open `css/projects.css` and find `font-family` on the `body` selector.
To switch to a Google Font, add this `@import` at the very top of the CSS file:
```css
/* Add this at the very top of the CSS file (before everything else) */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap');

body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;  /* Replace 'Inter' with your chosen font */
}
```
Browse free fonts at [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com) and copy the `@import` link they provide.

### Images

Open `about.html` and look for `<img src="...">` tags.
Replace the `src` value with a link to your own image or a local file path.
For background images defined in CSS, open `css/projects.css` and search for `background-image`.
